Packet Injection Overview:
==============================================================================================================
Start Time: 24-09-2023 12:58:28
End Time: 24-09-2023 13:03:52
Total Packets Injected: 1099
Packets injected using the flows file extracted from the MAWI dataset.
Flows extracted from dataset is labeled as elephant flows which are greater than 100MB.
There are two cost effective decision tree models used. One for classification at ingress
port of switch and the other is used for re-classification of flows on controller side.
The first model is trained on dataset extracted from MAWI and the other one is trained on the
the same dataset using 7 packet features and statistical features..

==============================================================================================================
Classification Overview:
==============================================================================================================
Total Flows: 339
Elephant Flows classified at Ingress Port: 51
Mice Flows classified at Ingress Port: 288
Elephant Flows classified by controller: 34
Mice Flows classified by controller: 17
Total flows finally classified as Elephant: 34
Total flows finally classified as mice: 305
