Start Time: 19-09-2023 22:36:03
End Time: 19-09-2023 22:36:04
Total Packets Injected: 486
Actual Elephants Injected: 0
Actual Mice Injected: 0
Packets injected using the flows file extracted from the MAWI dataset.
Flows extracted from dataset is labeled as elephant flows which are greater than 100MB.
There are two cost effective decision tree models used. One for classification at ingress
port of switch and the other is used for re-classification of flows on controller side.
The first model is trained on dataset extracted from MAWI and the other one is trained on the
the same dataset using 7 packet features and statistical features..
